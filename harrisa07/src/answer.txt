Q: What was your experience using Eclipse or your tool of choice to complete the assignments?

A: To tell the truth, learning how to use an IDE consumed a lot of my time. My programming history is mostly in
scripting, and I hadn’t used an IDE before this class. I tend to like writing code, and kind of pooh-poohed the
handholding and shortcuts the IDE gives developers. I ended up using Intellij IDEA, because I like being different and
because it just felt and looked a little more pleasing to me.

I’ve quickly understood that doing OOP and application programming without an IDE would be amazingly difficult. Just the
immediate error-checking it provides and the confirmation of variable, method, and class names on the fly prevent a ton
of really arduous work for the developer. For the most part it’s gone OK, but it took me a long time at first to figure
out the Project/Module paradigm, just understanding the rudiments of application programming, such as the directory
hierarchies, terminology, paths, and other myriad details that are common to most application programming languages… and
then the million IDE settings you have to discover to control all these behaviors.

CheckStyle has been almost more of an annoyance than a benefit. It flags errors for the most ridiculous things
sometimes, and I haven’t had time to figure out how to configure it to my liking. There’s some kind of error it throws a
lot which isn’t required but it interferes with my coding, so I end up disabling the plugin just so I can get some work
done. Hence I can miss some details that would be caught by CheckStyle, such as unused import statements and that sort
of thing. It’s been a learning process, and it has taken quite a lot of my study time, but I’m getting the hang of it.
